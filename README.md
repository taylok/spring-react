# Spring React

## Build out this example

1. The base react router has patterns to force all responses not on /api to the index file. 
2. Ignore Spring Security when running on kubernetes , allow a proxy that sits in front to handle authentication. Use JWTs to make sure scopes and roles.
3. How would the example look different with graphQL? You would just need to changethe fetch command.
